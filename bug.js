This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when you're using a component that dynamically generates classes based on props or state.  If the class names are not correctly formed according to Tailwind's naming conventions, the styles won't apply. This is often due to typos, incorrect use of template literals, or logic errors in generating the class names. For instance, a space may be missing between classes, or a class name may contain a typo or be incorrectly concatenated.
